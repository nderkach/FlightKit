# FlightKit aka "Flight booking for developers" &copy; aka "Flight booking which doesn't suck" &copy;

This is a very early version (pretty much useless at this point) of a white-label framework for flight booking.

Have an iOS travel app? Wouldn't it be great if your users could book flights right away?
So you've looked around for APIs to solve that, only to realise that you don't have much leverage as a developer?
I've been in the same boat, so I decided to build this.

No more crappy mobile websites, just the pure joy of native iOS flight shopping.

Stay tuned for more.
